Assignment 1: Control Redesign (Individual project)
Controls are a fundamental building block of interaction design. Controls are designed to be conduits between a user's intention and a system's ability to understand and act on that intent.
The goal of this assignment is to identify controls in everyday life that needs to be improved and redesign the control, considering the perceptual affordance, feedforward, feedback, and perceptual-motor skills.
